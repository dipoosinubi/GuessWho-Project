<h2>
OVERVIEW
</h2>

The goal of this project was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game that involved manipulating the DOM. I chose the challenge of creating this Hangman game because i believe it was a good way to put into practice what I have learnt so far in the Software Engineering Immersive course.
